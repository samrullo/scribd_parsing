      "LOCKBOX  1  On the second day of December in a year when a Georgia peanut farmer was doing  business in the White House, one of Colorado’s great resort hotels burned to the  ground\n",
      " The Overlook was declared a total loss\n",
      " After an investigation, the fire mar-  shal of Jicarilla County ruled the cause had been a defective boiler\n",
      " The hotel was  closed for the winter when the accident occurred, and only four people were  present\n",
      " Three survived\n",
      " The hotel’s off-season caretaker, John Torrance, was killed  during an unsuccessful (and heroic) effort to dump the boiler’s steam pressure,  which had mounted to disastrously high levels due to an inoperative relief valve\n",
      "  Two of the survivors were the caretaker’s wife and young son\n",
      " The third was the  Overlook’s chef, Richard Hallorann, who had left his seasonal job in Florida and  come to check on the Torrances because of what he called “a powerful hunch” that  the family was in trouble\n",
      " Both surviving adults were quite badly injured in the  explosion\n",
      " Only the child was unhurt\n",
      "  Physically, at least\n",
      "  2  Wendy Torrance and her son received a settlement from the corporation that  owned the Overlook\n",
      " It wasn’t huge, but enough to get them by for the three years  she was unable to work because of back injuries\n",
      " A lawyer she consulted told her  that if she were willing to hold out and play tough, she might get a great deal more,  because the corporation was anxious to avoid a court case\n",
      " But she, like the corpo-  ration, wanted only to put that disastrous winter in Colorado behind her\n",
      " She  would convalesce, she said, and she did, although back injuries plagued her until  the end of her life\n",
      " Shattered vertebrae and broken ribs heal, but they never cease  crying out\n",
      "  Winifred and Daniel Torrance lived in the mid-South for awhile, then drifted  down to Tampa\n",
      " Sometimes Dick Hallorann (he of the powerful hunches) came up  from Key West to visit with them\n",
      " To visit with young Danny especially\n",
      " They  shared a bond\n",
      "  One early morning in March of 1981, Wendy called Dick and asked if he could  come\n",
      " Danny, she said, had awakened her in the night and told her not to go in the  bathroom\n",
      "  After that, he refused to talk at all\n",
      "  3  He woke up needing to pee\n",
      " Outside, a strong wind was blowing\n",
      " It was warm—in  Florida it almost always was—but he did not like that sound, and supposed he  never would\n",
      " It reminded him of the Overlook, where the defective boiler had been  the very least of the dangers\n",
      "  He and his mother lived in a cramped second-floor tenement apartment\n",
      " Danny  left the little room next to his mother’s and crossed the hall\n",
      " The wind gusted and a  dying palm tree beside the building clattered its leaves\n",
      " The sound was skeletal\n",
      "  They always left the bathroom door open when no one was using the shower or the  toilet, because the lock was broken\n",
      " Tonight the door was closed\n",
      " Not because his  mother was in there, however\n",
      " Thanks to facial injuries she’d suffered at the Over-  look, she now snored—a soft queep-queep sound—and he could hear it coming  from her bedroom\n",
      "  Well, she closed it by accident, that’s all\n",
      "  He knew better, even then (he was possessed of powerful hunches and intu-  itions himself), but sometimes you had to know\n",
      " Sometimes you had to see\n",
      " This  was something he had found out at the Overlook, in a room on the second floor\n",
      "  Reaching with an arm that seemed too long, too stretchy, too boneless, he turned  the knob and opened the door\n",
      "  The woman from Room 217 was there, as he had known she would be\n",
      " She was  sitting naked on the toilet with her legs spread and her pallid thighs bulging\n",
      " Her  greenish breasts hung down like deflated balloons\n",
      " The patch of hair below her  stomach was gray\n",
      " Her eyes were also gray, like steel mirrors\n",
      " She saw him, and her  lips stretched back in a grin\n",
